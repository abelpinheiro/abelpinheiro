### Hi there 👋, I'm Abel
- 🔭 I’m currently working on C# and ASP.NET Core.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning C#, ASP.NET, Digital Image Processing and Control Systems.
- 📖 My goals are to further develop my skills in .NET and Android Development. I'd like to learn Go one day.
- ⚡ Fun fact: I love playing 🕹 retro games, playing the 🎻 violin, learning new languages (currently Japanese) and 🏊 swimming!
